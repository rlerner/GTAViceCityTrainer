# GTAViceCityTrainer
Macro that turns keystrokes into cheat codes (See Instant Dealership)

Built on June 27th, 2008 (> a decade ago), this Visual Basic 6.0 application uses keylogging techniques (monitors keyboard inputs) for specific keystrokes, when these keystrokes are detected, it will then emulate a keyboard and type sequences.

In this case, by pressing a letter on the keyboard, the trainer will enter cheat codes (sometimes multiple times, as in Instant Dealership).

This is a shortcut and not a memory modifier. It uses in-built interfaces in the game (that of the keyboard).

Do note that running this program outside of GTA VC will simply result in annoying random keystrokes.
